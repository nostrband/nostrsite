Nostr Sites
===========

Nostr Site allows one to display a curated selection of Nostr events on a website.

A web page that is part of the Nostr Site MUST include `nostr:site` meta tag:
```
<meta property="nostr:site" content="<naddr>" /> 
```

The `site` event, referenced by `naddr` from `nostr:site` meta tag, is a parameterized replaceable event of kind `30512`. The `content` field MAY contain a rich description of the site in markdown syntax (NIP-23), all tags are optional except `d`.

Tags:
- "d": sitename

// general info
- "r" - absolute url of the nostr site root (may include /path/)
- "title" - human readable name
- "summary" - show intro on why the site exists
- "image": preview url

// curation tags, each may be specified multiple times 
- ["p", <pubkey>] - contributors, if omitted - event's author is the single site contributor
- ["include", "<tag>", "<value>"] - filters for fetching published events
- ["kind", "30023"] - curated events kind, default - any kind
- ["relay", "<relay>"] - override contributors' relays 

// web site engine and extensions (theme, plugins etc)
- ["x", "<id>", "<relay>", "<package-hash>", "<petname>"] - event id and hash of the extension package (theme, plugin)
- ["z", "<engine>"] - renderer engine, preferably reverse-domain notation, should match theme engine and plugin engine, i.e. `pro.npub.v1`

// meta tags for website rendering, seo, social, navigation
- "icon": favicon url
- "logo": header logo url
- "lang": language
- "meta_title"
- "meta_description"
- "og_title"
- "og_description"
- "og_image"
- "twitter_image"
- "twitter_title"
- "twitter_description"
- "nav", "/relative/url", "label" - primary navigation

By default, no events are published on the site. 

Admin MAY use `include` tags to specify which events, authored by contributors, should be displayed on the site. `include` contains a `key:value` pair of single-letter tag and it's value that will be used as filters to fetch published events, i.e. `t:bitcoin` or `g:<geohash>`. A special value of `*` means "everything". 

If `kind` tags are specified, only these kinds will be fetched.

If `relay` tags are specified, only these relays will be used, overriding the outbox relays of the contributors.

If `include` has a special value of `?` then "manual" submission is enabled and contributors MAY create `submit` events that reference the target events to be published on the site.

"Submit" events
===============

Events of kind `512` are used by Nostr Site contributors to submit an event to the site (manual submission must be enabled with `include=?`). `content` field may be empty, tags may include:
- ["a", "<addr>", "<relay>", "site"] - addr of the target site
- ["a"/"e", "<addr/id>", <relay>] - addr/id of the submitted event 
- ["k", "<kind>"] - submitted event's kind, to allow filtering by target event's kind
- ["r", "<slug>"] - optional slug for submitted event, to be used in the website url, i.e. /posts/<slug>.html.

If `relay` tags are specified in `site` event, `submit` events will only be fetched from those relays.

If target event is authored by none of the contributors, it should be rendered as a `repost` by the contributor and show the original author.

If `r` tag's value starts with `/` then this a relative url of a `static page` (i.e. `r:/path/to/static/page`). The submitted events referenced by `a` or `e` tags of `static pages` SHOULD NOT be included when listing published events, but are only rendered at the specified url. If no `a` or `e` tags are specified in a `submit` event, then it's `content` field will be rendered as the content of the static page - this allows to exclude such static pages from social media feeds.

If several `submit` events published by contributors have the same `r` tag then the most recent one should be preferred.

Submit events should be deleted using NIP-09 to remove an event from the site. 

Hashtag pages
=============

Sites may need to display additional info on web pages displaying hashtags, and may use `hashtag` event published by contributors for that. The `hashtag` event is a parameterized replaceable event of kind `30513`. the `content` field may include a string of text in the same format as "long-form content" NIP-23, to be used as the body of the hashtag web page. Hashtag event will have tags: 

- "t" - target hashtag, must be included exactly once
- "a" - nostr site address, at least one
- "slug" - url-friendly hashtag name (i.e. get-started)
- "summary"
- "image" - url
- "meta_title"
- "meta_description"
- "og_title"
- "og_description"
- "og_image"
- "twitter_image"
- "twitter_title"
- "twitter_description"

If several `hashtag` events published by contributors have the same `r` tag then the most recent one should be preferred.

Themes/Skins and Plugins
========================

The `theme` event is parameterized replaceable event of kind `30514`, it's `content` field may have a "rich" description in the same syntax as NIP-23 long-form notes. It has the following tags:

- "title"
- "summary"
- "version" - latest version of the theme
- "license"
- "e" - event id of the latest release as `1036` package event
- "z", "pro.npub.v1" - engine, must match the nostr site engine

The `plugin` event is parameterized replaceable event of kind `30515` with the same structure.

The `package` event of kind `1036` (see the new NIP-513) is essentially a directory of files - relative urls and hashes. It may contain release notes, and also contains the `package hash` - a combined hash of all files
and their relative urls. 

The `package` event SHOULD have additional tags:
- "l", "theme"|"plugin", "org.nostrsites.ontology" - label
- "L", "org.nostrsites.ontology" - label category
- "a" - address of the theme or plugin replaceable event

The `site` events are linked to the themes and plugins using package event ids, and also the `package hash` (see `site` event above). This will allow us to handle link rot - if theme package event is deleted by relays, other events with the same `package hash` can be found to avoid disruption of every site using the deleted package.  

Rendering
=========

Steps to render a Nostr Site to produce an HTML page:
- parse site event `naddr` from meta-tags of the HTML fetched from the server (or from index.html for server-side rendering)
- fetch `site event` from relays specified in `naddr`
 - if not found, fall back to fetching `naddr` author's outbox relays
- fetch extensions (plugins and themes)
- if `include` tags are specified then
 - fetch authors' relays (will be omitted if single admin-author)
 - fetch by tags from those authors from their outbox relays
- if `include="?"` is specified:
 - fetch authors' relays (will be omitted if single admin-author)
 - fetch `submit` events from authors' outbox relays
 - fetch targets (may include fetching target authors' relays)
- init template engine and render the target events into html
- if root is specified, renderer should put all nostr-site links inside this sub-path
