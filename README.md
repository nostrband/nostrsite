NostrSites is a client-side nip-512 engine for rendering HTML pages from Nostr events using Ghost themes.

It takes the engine from libnostrsite and adds all wrappers required to run it inside a browser tab and in a service-worker. 

This is a very early work in progress, lots of features are missing or partially implemented, use at your own risk.
