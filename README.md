NostrSites is built around nip512 "Nostr Sites" spec.

It uses nip512 events, along with it's own custom events, to store website settings and configuration.

It is heavily based on Ghost in terms of website structure and routing, and uses Ghost themes, so your Ghost website should be easy to port to a Nostr Site.
